# 4180_Final_Project
**Team members:** Andrew Gunawan, Bo Pang, Tianle Li
## Project Overview
### Short Summary
For this project, we built an RC surveillance vehicle. The vehicle has a rotating camera and two wheels driven by their own motors. The user can use Xbox Controller to control the speed of each wheel and rotate the camera so it can capture visual data from different angles. The vehicle can transmit real-time videos feed to a network. It also has a braking system and a speaker so that it can stop when detecting obstacles and set alarm.
